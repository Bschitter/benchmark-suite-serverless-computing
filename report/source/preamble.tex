\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would first like to thank my thesis advisers Prof. Dr. Pascal Felber and Dr. Valerio Schiavoni of the university of Neuch√¢tel. They both allowed me to work on this topic by myself but were always available when I needed help or had questions and gave me valuable comments on this thesis.
\newline
\newline
I would also like to acknowledge my girlfriend Stephanie Abgottspon and my sister Samina Maissen for proofreading this thesis.
\newline
\newline
Finally I need to express great gratitude to my parents and my grandfather for supporting me upon this point in my life. Not only did they support me financially but they also encouraged me to pursue my dream of becoming a graduate of the university in computer science. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them.

Thank you
