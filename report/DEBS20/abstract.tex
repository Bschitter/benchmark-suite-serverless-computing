Currently there is a big trend towards cloud computing. Among all the services the cloud offers, serverless computing is very popular and every large cloud service provider offers a serverless platform. However, there has not been much effort to test, benchmark or compare these services. This thesis tries to take an approach on benchmarking serverless computing with building a suite that everyone can use.
\newline
This suite provides five different tests to benchmark on four different clouds, highly automated deployment and cleanup of these tests, a testing utility for comparing cloud providers, a heavy benchmark to load test the serverless platforms and a pricing calculator to estimate hypothetical and actual costs. Everything is packaged with Docker and is easy to use.
\newline
This benchmark suite is completely open source and the code and the documentation can be found at \url{https://github.com/bschitter/benchmark-suite-serverless-computing}.
